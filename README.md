# L-NeRF(L-NeRF: Local Importance Sampling for Enhanced Neural Radiance Fields)
<!--
[NeRF](http://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf) (Neural Radiance Fields) is a method that achieves state-of-the-art results for synthesizing novel views of complex scenes. Here are some videos generated by this repository (pre-trained models are provided below):

This project improves the clarity of surface
details and significantly surpasses traditional NeRF(Nerf-pytorch) in view synthesis quality. Moreover, L-NeRF
accentuates the demarcation between the rendered model and the scene, enhancing visual perception and
facilitating the segmentation of key objects for further research. Compared to the original NeRF model,
this method enhances rendering quality by approximately 10% while reducing training time by nearly 25%. 

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/lifeixiao/L-NeRF.git
cd L-NeRF
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

  ## Dependencies
  - PyTorch 1.4
  - matplotlib
  - numpy
  - imageio
  - imageio-ffmpeg
  - configargparse
  
The LLFF data loader requires ImageMagick.

You will also need the [LLFF code](http://github.com/fyusion/llff) (and COLMAP) set up to compute poses if you want to run on your own real data.

## How To Run?

### Quick Start

Download data for two example datasets: `lego` and `fern`
```
bash download_example_data.sh
```

To train a low-res `lego` NeRF:
```
python run_nerf.py --config configs/lego.txt
```
<!--
After training for 100k iterations (~4 hours on a single 2080 Ti), you can find the following video at `logs/lego_test/lego_test_spiral_100000_rgb.mp4`.

To train a low-res `fern` NeRF:
```
python run_nerf.py --config configs/fern.txt
```
<!--
After training for 200k iterations (~8 hours on a single 2080 Ti), you can find the following video at `logs/fern_test/fern_test_spiral_200000_rgb.mp4` and `logs/fern_test/fern_test_spiral_200000_disp.mp4`

To train NeRF on different datasets: 

```
python run_nerf.py --config configs/{DATASET}.txt
```

replace `{DATASET}` with `trex` | `horns` | `flower` | `fortress` | `lego` | etc.

---

To test NeRF trained on different datasets: 

```
python run_nerf.py --config configs/{DATASET}.txt --render_only
```

replace `{DATASET}` with `trex` | `horns` | `flower` | `fortress` | `lego` | etc.

### Reproducibility 

Tests that ensure the results of all functions and training loop match the official implentation are contained in a different branch `reproduce`. One can check it out and run the tests:
```
git checkout reproduce
py.test
```

> A neural radiance field is a simple fully connected network (weights are ~5MB) trained to reproduce input views of a single scene using a rendering loss. The network directly maps from spatial location and viewing direction (5D input) to color and opacity (4D output), acting as the "volume" so we can use volume rendering to differentiably render new views
